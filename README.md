## kba-overlap

This repository contains the code to calculate the 3 of the SDG Indicators related to protected area coverage of KBAs split into marine, terrestrial, freshwater and mountain KBAs. 

This repository contains 3 scripts that form part of the analyses: 
1.  code to run the KBA-protected area overlap analyses,
1.  code that assigns years of designation to protected areas with no reported year of designation,
1.  code to generate graphs of KBA-protected area overlap for countries and various regional disaggregations. 

These codes are documented in the pdf report. 

There are also addition scripts used for the 2020 SDG indicators (run December 2019) which include code to classify KBAs to one or more of the three systems in this analyses (excluding freshwater which is done via another method) and code to generate the data formatted for the SDG reporting.
